# sql_practice_problems

While searching for the best books to learn SQL, I stumbled upon a book called "SQL Practice Problems" by Sylvia Moestl Vasilik.
This resource consists of 57 challenges, ranging from beginner to intermediate, and progressing to more advanced levels.
The book adopts a "learn by doing" approach, significantly contributing to my SQL proficiency.

As I navigated through the challenges, I encountered a gradual increase in complexity, pushing me to explore various online resources to find solutions. This process not only solidified my understanding of SQL concepts but also sharpened my problem-solving skills.

The book utilizes a modified version of the Northwind Database. It's worth noting that the basic version of the database, typically available for free, won't suffice for the exercises. You'll receive the modified database upon purchasing the book.

In this repository, you'll find my solutions to the challenges presented in the book.
If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
